# ACU_Redirect-Chrome-Extension

Version: 1.0

Purpose of creation: 
  To make the annoying pane of AcuStudio (that appear when you click pause/play and sometimes just stay there blcoking half of the view for a long time) disappear. Hopefully this will also help other ntu students that dislikes this pane. 

Function:
  Redirect from AcuStudio to the video link found in its source code (then the configurations of the original video player will be gone and the annoying banner will not appear). 
  Pause/Play the video using Ctrl+Space shortcut (after redirect, unable to pause/play the video by clicking on it).

Note:
  Suggest to use with another chrome extension -- Video Speed Controller. As after the redirection there will not be settings to control the video speed. 
  
Control:
  Use Ctrl+Shift+Right for redirection. 
  Use Ctrl+Space for play/pause after redirection.

Future improvement:
  Enable user to modify the shortcut.
  Become a completed extension (not under developer mode).
  Integrate with Video Speed Controller (if possible).


Installation:
  Download the files --> Enable 'Developer Mode' in chrome extension --> 'Load Unpacked' --> Select the whole file --> Done!
